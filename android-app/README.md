This is a 'fork' from the Tensorflow repository, where I made some changes to use my trained model and remove the unused ones. xxx

This code is inteded to show how we created an app using Tensorflow and should not be used in production. If you want to create an app or follow the latest changes on the Tensorflow Android example, please go to the original source: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android

To make things easier about the changes that were made, I added the file differences.patch which contains everything that was modified from the Tensorflow repository.
